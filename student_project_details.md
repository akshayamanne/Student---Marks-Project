Student Marks Project
This is a simple python program. Used to calculate Total, Average, and Result like ( pass / fail).


Features:
- Enter the name of the student.
- Enter the marks of 5 subject.
- You can calculate the result like pass / fail.
- Check if the student is passed or failed.


How I Made It:
- I used input, loop, if-else condition.
- No Libraries Used.


Why I done this:
- This is my first mini project to apply what I know.
